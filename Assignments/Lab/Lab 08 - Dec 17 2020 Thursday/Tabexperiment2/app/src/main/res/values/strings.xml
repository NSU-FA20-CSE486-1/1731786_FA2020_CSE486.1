    <string name="tech_news">Staying secure in the modern world is more difficult than ever. Every day, we face threats to our identities, our personal information, our data, and even ourselves. From malware attacks to phishing schemes, we survey the security landscape. It takes a lot more than some anti-virus software to stay safe. We go beyond the sensationalism to assess which threats could pose the biggest problems and dig into the repercussions that ripple through our lives once security has been compromised. KEEP GOING.
    Innovations in materials, artificial intelligence, and stealth technology are continually retooling modern warfare. Here we delve into the latest developments, be that ultra stealthy fuselages, superalloys that make engines more efficient, or tanks with radar-guided munitions and projectile launchers. If you're fascinated by drones, catapults, and aircraft with foldable wings, take heart: you're not alone.
    These are the devices that get you through the day—your smartphone, your wristwatch, your home monitoring system. We'll break down the coolest features of new products, as well as explain what type of person should drop cash on them. And listen, even if you're not the type to buy every new piece of electronic gear the week it comes out, you'll want to stay informed. Future you will be grateful. </string>
    <string name="cooking_tips">Ideally, you should use oil that has been used a few times and has had the chance to break down a bit. Because they haven\'t broken down at all, the molecules in brand new oil may not bond well with your french fries. As a result, your fries won\'t be as crispy. On the other hand, oil that is at the end of its life in your fryer may have some residual flavors from other menu items, or it may start to smoke as a result of too much breakdown.
    The best method for achieving perfect, crispy french fries is to deep fry your potatoes twice. Below, we’ll explain the best way to prepare potatoes for frying, how long to fry french fries, and how long you can hold fries before serving.Wash the potatoes.
Optional: Peel the potatoes.
Cut the potatoes to your desired size. You can cut them by hand or use a french fry cutter for maximum efficiency and uniformity.
Soak the potatoes for 3 to 24 hours in a water and vinegar mixture. Soaking them will help to remove the excess starch and promote crispness. To make the mixture, put 1 tablespoon of vinegar into a gallon of water. This vinegar will help to keep the potatoes from oxidizing and discoloring.
Dry the potatoes. It is important to dry your potatoes before frying them to prevent spattering. Use a clean towel to pat them dry on a sheet pan or put them into a salad dryer to remove the excess moisture. If you store the potatoes uncovered in your cooler overnight, this will help to further dry them out.
Blanch the potatoes by frying them at 325 degrees for 3-6 minutes.The time will vary depending on the cut of your fries. Smaller cuts like 3/8 inch will take 2-3 minutes. Larger cuts like 1/4 or 1/2 inch will take 4-6 minutes. You are done blanching the potatoes when you can bend them without breaking them.
Cool the fries before frying them a second time. For efficiency, you can blanch several batches of potatoes and let them cool in your fridge or walk-in cooler. When it’s almost time to serve them, remove them from the cooler to be fried a second time.
seasoned french fries
Fry them a second time at 375 degrees for 2-3 minutes. Since you have already blanched the potatoes to partially cook them, this second round in the fryer will make them crispy. Look for a golden brown exterior to know they’re finished.
Season the fries while the oil is still hot. The hot oil will help your seasonings stick to the fries. Use salt, spices, fresh herbs, or even oils to flavor your fries.
Serve your fries within 10 minutes of completing them. The ideal holding time for french fries is no more than 5 to 10 minutes. After that, the fries will lose some of their crispiness and become cold.</string>

    <string name="drama">Pithy Scots brogue and throwaway insults punctuate Outlander, the phenomenally successful TV series that explores the final great Jacobite uprising of 1745 – the rebellion against King George II led by Bonnie Prince Charlie. Like 18th-century period dress or columns of troops, the Scots language is colourfully employed to lend authenticity to the drama.

The Scots spoken in Outlander may not be the language spoken today in Scotland, but rather a stage-Scots – essentially English dressed in tartan and cockade – yet it is still to be cheered. In fact, the presence of Scots in Outlander is a sign of how far an historically repressed language has come in just a few decades.
    But this language has been repressed – forced out of education, media and business life. Interestingly, the fate and fall of Scots were bound together with those of Jacobitism, a movement intended to restore Scotland’s former independence, religious tolerance and the Stewart dynasty to the Scottish and English thrones.
    This is where Jacobitism enters the tale. In the run-up to the ‘45 rebellion, the Jacobites drew heavily upon all manner of symbols to emphasise the Scottishness of their cause. They declared support for an independent Scotland, clad themselves in tartan and bore the cross of Saint Andrew. They also weaponised the Scots language to endear their cause to the common man.</string>

    <string name="top">According to a whistleblower, the SEC has been systematically destroying records of investigations for the last twenty years:  By whitewashing the files of some of the nation\'s worst financial criminals, the SEC has kept an entire generation of federal investigators in the dark about past inquiries into insider trading, fraud and market manipulation against companies like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and AIG. With a few strokes of the keyboard, the evidence gathered during thousands of investigations – \"18,000 ... including Madoff,\" as one high-ranking SEC official put it during a panicked meeting about the destruction – has apparently disappeared forever into the wormhole of history.</string>
