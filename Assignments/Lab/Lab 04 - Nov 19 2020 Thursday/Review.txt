- An extra is a bundle, that is a key-value pair which is used to add data that is passed from the intent,from one activity to the other activity.
- When we create a public variable, it is available to any activity in my app. All the activities in my app wwill be able to identify it.
- For the key name we create a public static final String variable, and set it to "package name (since its always unique) and then add .EXTRA.message (which is unique WITHIN our app)"
	 Example: public static final string Extra_message = "com.salmaabdulhai.com.logINscreen.EXTRA.message"
- After creating an intent that starts the next activity, we create an intent in the second activity to get any intent if available when the second activity was launched. 
	Example: Intent intent = getIntent()
- In order to get the string from the extras, we need to know what the key is. We have created the unique public constant and now we will assign it to a String varibale to get the data.
	Example: String message = intent.getStringExtra( MainActivity.Extra_Message). This will pull the id of extra_message from the mainActivity and extract the value and assign it to the message.


Intents:
When an activity returns (example sending a reply back to the main activity) it sends messages like RESULT_OK, RESULT_CANCELLED etc.
We setResult instead of starting activity(from the replying end). setResult takes in two parameters RESULT_CODE, data/message/reply(in this case).
Then we use the finish method and this will take us back to the main activity because of the child and parent relationship. (WEW!)

In the mainActivity (the sender end) we need anoother public constant to identify the key for a specific kind of response. 
When you get a response back from an activity or applications, they could be of different types.
